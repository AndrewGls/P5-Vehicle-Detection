    "# Vehicle Detection Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project was to write software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. To detect vehicles, at first, we had to use an approach which was very popular in computer vision 10+ years ago and includes two common steps: feature extraction and prediction based on trained Linear SVM classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "* a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a Linear SVM classifier. \n",
    "* a color transform and binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to combine the HOG feature vector with other coomon computer vision approaches.\n",
    "* a sliding-window technique combined with trained SVM classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* creating a heatmap of recurring detections in subsequent frames of a video stream to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* estimation of bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The developed pipeline was used to draw bounding boxes around detected vehicels in the video.\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "* Clone the project and create directories `vehicles` and `non-vehicles`. \n",
    "* Download images from the links given below (see Data Exploration) and put them into subfolders below `vehicles` and `non-vehicles`. \n",
    "* use `explore_data.ipynb` to look at the samples in data set, used for training Linear SVM classifier.\n",
    "* `train_hog_classifier.py` or `train_hog_classifier.ipynb` trains the Liniear SVM classifier to detect cars and non-cars. The classifier data is saved in a pickle file, `HOGClassifier.p` by default.\n",
    "* `video_vehicle_detection.py` or `video_vehicle_detection.ipynb` implements a sliding-window technique to search for vehicles with including false positive filtering in the video.\n",

    "The labeled vehicle and non-vehicle images with the size 64x64 pixels were taken from the [GTI](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html) vehicle image database, the [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) vision benchmark suite, and examples extracted from the project video itself. A third [data set](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations) from Udacity was not used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total combination of data sets contains 8792 vehicle images and 8968 non-vehicle images. The data set is slightly 2% unbalanced - more non vehicle images than vehicle images. The images of [GTI](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html) data set are taken from video sequences. The [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) data set contains the same vehicle appear more than once, but typically under significantly different lighting/angle from other instances. Here is an example of the vehicle and non-vehicle classes:\n",

    "##  HOG feature extraction, color and spatial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collected data set was randomized train-test splited on 80% training set and 20% test set. The GTI data set contains time-series data, extracted from video, with sequences of images where the vehicles target objects appear almost identical in a whole series of images. While it is possible to achieve a sufficiently good result on the project without worrying about time-series issues, it is better to remove similar objects to improve the performace of SVM classifier.\n",
